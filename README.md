# A fun little *gamification* Add-on called "GameIT"
This [i-doit](https://www.i-doit.com/) Add-on adds a fun little competition layer
to the software. For each action inside the CMDB you'll receive points - for example
when creating a new object or updating a category.
  
This Add-on will connect to a few technical signals in order to observe changes.
You can also take a look at this Add-on as a "code example" for you own development ;)
